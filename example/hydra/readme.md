# Leviathan node CLI

This is an example CLI client that we use for testing and interfacing with Leviathan while developing. Since levithan will be used in [DevU](https://github.com/makeopensource/devU/), node has been chosen as the client language,

This is not meant as real production usage unless your users like the terminal, 
you are expected to use the code in the ```client``` and implement it in your own service.

# Building and running

The project is designed to be simple can be run using a single file
```
node main.ts
```

```
running 
```
