# Leviathan typescript client

This is auto generated client, to interact with the leviathan API.

This was autogenerated using the [connnectrpc-node](https://connectrpc.com/docs/node/getting-started)

## Important note
### No files inside [src/generated](./src/generated) should ever be manually modified, these are autogenerated files.

# Install

To use the client TS code install it via:

```
npm install 'https://gitpkg.vercel.app/makeopensource/leviathan/.spec/client?master'
```
